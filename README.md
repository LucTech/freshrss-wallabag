# FreshRSS Wallabag Button

This [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org) adds a button to each article
which adds the respective article to your
[Wallabag](https://wallabag.it) installation.

FreshRSS already comes with a pretty good integration with Wallabag
through its share feature. The author of this plugin was annoyed by the
fact that the share feature is just a simple link, which means that a
new tab opens when a article is added to Wallabag. This extension uses
the Wallabag API and sends the request from the server side. This means
that your workflow of skipping through articles is not interrupted when
you add an article to Wallabag.
